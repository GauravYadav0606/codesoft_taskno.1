## Project Overview

This is a fun console-based game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. The game gives hints if the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is found.

---

## Objective

- Create a simple guessing game using C++.
- Help users practice logical thinking and number sense.

---

## Key Activities

- Generate a random number using `rand()` and `srand()`.
- Use a loop to let the user guess again and again.
- Give helpful messages like “Too low” or “Too high”.
- Count how many attempts it took to guess right.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `iostream` (for input/output)  
  - `cstdlib` (for random number)  
  - `ctime` (for random seed based on time)

---

## Key Insights

- Learned how to use random numbers in C++.  
- Got hands-on with loops and conditions.  
- Practiced user input and output handling.  
- Created a fun, working game from scratch.
